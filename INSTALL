DS18S20Library Installation Manual


This short HOWTO describes the installation procedure for DS18S20Library on Linux
with help of Make, avr-libc and avr-gcc compiler.
For other platforms and building tools, check the documentation of those tools how to create
a static libraries.

Prerequisites:
- GNU binutils and GNU gcc compiler built for AVR targets;
- AVR-libc.


Installation

1. Navigate to the library folder.
2. Build the library with:

  #make [mcu=<device_name>|cpu_freq=<frequency>]

Calling make with no arguments, results with buld for Atmega32 MCU and CPU frequency of 16MHz.
Use the command line arguments from above for setting the required mcu and cpu_freq values.

3. Install the library by executing:

  #sudo make install

The destination folder for the library file is defined by the Makefile variable $PREFIX and the MCU name.
By default, the library is installed in:

  /usr/local/lib/avr8/$MCU

or
  /usr/local/lib/avr8/amega32

The library header file will land in:

  /usr/local/include/avr8



Uninstalling the Library

  #sudo make uninstall
